# Privacy Policy

I respect your privacy, and I have no interest in collecting your personal data (aside from an email address in order to send you Meticulous Monster updates, if you decide to join the mailing list). I definitely have no interest in sharing your personal information with anyone else. For the sake of transparency, I've listed below all the ways information can be collected from you on this website.

## Web Analytics

I use [Clicky](https://clicky.com/){:target="_blank"} for the purpose of keeping track of traffic to this website. This tool collects information such as how many unique visitors I get, which pages they view, how they got here, and what browsers they use. This lets me find out if this site is getting visitors, along with the best ways of letting interested people know about it. All of this data is anonymous. If, for some reason, you want to opt out of contributing to these analytics, you can enable the Do Not Track feature of your browser, or you can opt out [here](https://clicky.com/optout){:target="_blank"}. If you want to read Clicky's privacy policy, you can find it [here](https://clicky.com/terms/privacy){:target="_blank"}.

## Mailing List

I use [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/){:target="_blank"} to manage the Meticulous Monster mailing list. If you sign up for the mailing list, I will have access to your email address via MailChimp. If you've given me your email address, I assume that's because you have some level of trust in me, and you're interested in the games I'm making. I'm grateful for that trust, and I take it seriously. I will not spam you or share your email address with anyone else. If, for some reason, I decide to switch to a MailChimp alternative, I will export your email address to that alternative and then delete it from MailChimp. If you decide you no longer want to receive emails from me, you can click the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email I send you. If you want to read MailChimp's privacy policy, you can find it [here](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/){:target="_blank"}.
