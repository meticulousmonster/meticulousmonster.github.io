## Games

Right now, Meticulous Monster's first game, Bludgeon, is in development. I've been demoing it at some events around the area, and people seem to like it! It's at the point where the core gameplay is pretty much done, and I'm now working on adding more features/levels/characters and polishing it up. Check out more details at the link below!

## About

At Meticulous Monster, I aim to make games that are meaningful to people. Games are a powerful medium -- they can bring people together, tell amazing stories, provide new experiences, and help people through difficult times. Video games have been and continue to be an important part of my life, and it's been great watching them evolve and improve over the years. I've always wanted to make games myself, so I'm ramping up my skills and going for it.

I've always been a detail-oriented person. *Meticulous*, you might say. When doing work, I tend to agonize over small decisions and do a lot of research to find the best solution. Doing quality work is important to me, and I hope that comes across in the games I make. Humor is important, too. I may even throw in some nihilism and cynicism along the way. I'm not above that!
