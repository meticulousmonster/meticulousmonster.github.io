## About

At Meticulous Monster, my goal is to make fun games that are meaningful to people. Games are a powerful medium -- they can bring people together, tell amazing stories, and help people through difficult times. Video games have been and continue to be an important part of my life, and I've enjoyed watching them evolve and improve over the years. Making games is something I've wanted to do my whole life, so I'm ramping up my skills and going for it.

I've always been a detail-oriented person. *Meticulous*, you might say. When doing work, I tend to agonize over small decisions and exhaustively research the best solution. Doing quality work is important to me, and I hope this comes across in the games I make.

If you'd like to read development updates and other content from me, check out [my personal blog](https://colececil.io/){:target="_blank"}.
