## Description

Meticulous Monster is a one-person indie game development company whose goal is to make fun, polished games that are meaningful to people. This can be done in various ways, such as bringing people together, telling a good story, or creating a unique experience. Inspired by all the great games that have come before, Meticulous Monster wants to play its own part in the evolution of games as a positive force in the world.

## History

In 2017, Cole Cecil started Meticulous Monster in preparation for releasing his first commercial game, Bludgeon. He'd been dabbling in game development off and on for the previous ten or fifteen years, ever since he took his first programming class in college. A few years before starting Meticulous Monster, Cole decided to get serious about game development and started spending more time learning and practicing the necessary skills.
